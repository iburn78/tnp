npm install express
npm install ejs
npm install -g nodemon
    * npm install -g nodemon or npm i -g nodemon installs nodemon on the global scope where it is referenced in your system PATH variable, 
    * that way you can easily call nodemon on the CLI and since it's full installation path is referenced in your system PATH variable
npm install sqlite3
